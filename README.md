# QuickNote

Hi! Welcome to project QuickNote. QuickNote aims to optimise the learning experience and better help encorporate active recall into one's studying. 
QuickNote will compile all kinds of resources such as youtube videos, websites and pdf's into flashcards and question papers.

**Things to take note**

1. env file to be noted. I have kept the following variables in my dotenv file - openai token, "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS", project id and bucket name

2. There is also a multiple user issue as video name is not unique. So when multiple people use this, it may end up crashing the system. So once we are 
closer to completing the back end and begin front end development, we should consider how this will function with multiple users - possibly requiring mongodb


**This project is incomplete and abandoned, until further considerstaion**
