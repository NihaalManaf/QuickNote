# QuickNote

**Things to take note
**
1. .env file
    I have kept the following variables in my dotenv file - openai token, "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS", project id and bucket name

2. Multiple user issue
   Video name is not unique. So when multiple people use this, it may end up crashing the system. So once we are 
   closer to completing the back end and begin front end production, we should consider how this will function 
   with multiple users. possibly requiring mongodb
